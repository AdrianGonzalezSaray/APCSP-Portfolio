      First Large Scratch Game
    </h2>
    <p>
      In this game, you play as characters based on Don Lugos 
      LEAD academy teachers. The game is a parody of the Legend
      of Zelda games with additions from other games as well.
      In the preview shown above you see the movement of the
      character as well as some dialouge and a portion of the
      first boss battle. In this game I got more experience with
      coding in Scratch, using the scrum method, and was able to
      intergrate the mouse and keyboard in the game. It helped me
      with practicing the development of code process.

      First Large App Inventor App
    </h2>
    <p>
      In this app, which we call "Choose That Pokemon", you are able
      to see information on all the starter pokemon of every generation
      of Pokemon. We used the MIT App Inventor website to create this app.
      In the app, you are able to pick the generation of pokemon that you 
      want to chose from and afterwards you are able to choose from the 
      three starters in any particular order. You can also go back to the 
      generation menu at any time with the 'Back' button in the top left 
      corner.

    <h2>
      Python Interactive Story
    </h2>
    <p>
      In this project, we made a story that could be changed by the user.
      The story was made as a tribute to Mr. Engstrom, which is why he is
      the main character. You read from his perspective and make decisions
      based on what happened in the story. You are given two options and 
      told to pick between the two by entering a letter designated for each
      choice. We made it using python version 2.7 on the website repl.it.

    <h2>
      Python Project You Love; GPA Calculator
    </h2>
    <p>
      In this project, we made a calculator for GPA's based on the class
      grades the user would enter. It takes into account the weighted 
      grades system and has instructions to work with that. The user 
      just puts in all of the letter grades they currently have and the 
      code will count how many classes they have and the total amount of
      GPA points they get. It divides that to get the total GPA. It then
      reports that GPA and repeats itself. We also made this on python 
      version 2.7 on the website repl.it.

      Big Data
    </h2>
    <p>
      In this project, we found sets of data on the most viewed television
      shows in the USA in 2018. We used this data to find the most viewed
      genre of television. The graph below shows the percentages of the USAs
      favorite television genre.
